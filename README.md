# Minimal Login Interface 
This is a clean, high-quality login page I built with a focus on User Experience (UX) and Visual Simplicity. Instead of relying on heavy frameworks, I used pure web technologies to keep the code fast, lightweight, and easy for any developer to read.

## Key Features
* **Clean Design:** A professional, white-themed card layout that looks great on any screen size.
* **Handmade Toggle Switch:** I built the "Remember me" switch from scratch using pure CSS. It gives the UI a more premium feel compared to default browser buttons.
* **Password Toggle:** I added a simple JavaScript feature that lets users show or hide their password with a single click to prevent typing errors.
* **Sharp Iconography:** I used black SVG icons to ensure the interface looks crisp and professional on both mobile and desktop displays.
* **Fully Responsive:** Using Flexbox, I made sure the login card stays perfectly centered and scales naturally across all devices.

## Why I Built This
My goal was to show how small details—like proper white space and custom-built UI elements—can make a simple form feel like a high-end application. I also prioritized keeping the project organized by separating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into their own clean files.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** For a clean, semantic, and accessible structure.
* **CSS3:** For custom styling, smooth transitions, and responsive behavior.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For fast, lightweight UI interactions without the need for external libraries.
