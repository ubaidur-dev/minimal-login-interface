# minimal-login-interface 💻
This is a simple, high-quality login page I built to focus on clean design and smooth user interactions. Instead of using heavy frameworks, I used basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep the code lightweight and easy to read.

# Key Features
**Minimalist Design:** A professional white-themed card layout that looks great on any screen.
**Custom Toggle Switch:** I built a custom "Remember me" switch from scratch using pure CSS to give it a premium feel.
**Password Toggle:** Added a small JavaScript feature that lets users show or hide their password with a click.
**SVG Iconography:** Used sharp black SVG icons to ensure the UI looks crisp on both mobile and desktop.
**Fully Responsive:** The layout is built with Flexbox, so it stays perfectly centered and scales well on all devices.

# Why I Built This
The goal was to demonstrate how small details—like the right amount of white space and custom UI elements—can make a simple login form look like it belongs in a high-end application. I also focused on keeping the folder structure organized by separating the HTML, CSS, and JS files.

# Tech Used
**HTML5:** For a clean and accessible structure.
**CSS3:** For custom styling, animations, and responsive layout.
**Vanilla JavaScript:** For simple and fast UI logic.
